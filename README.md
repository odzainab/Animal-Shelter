# Animal-Shelter
This project analyzes 2020–2025 animal shelter data to uncover intake patterns, high-risk populations, and operational bottlenecks. Using an interactive Power BI dashboard, insights guide staffing, adoption, foster programs, and preventive strategies to improve live-release rates, reduce length-of-stay, and optimize capacity.
